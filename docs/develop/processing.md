# Pre- and post-processing

When you serialize a model, you want to keep it very basic in terms of the frameworks you use, it doesn't have any custom logic. Just e.g. a neural network, nothing else. 

Unique from model serialization frameworks because it bundles pre- and post-process

## Pre-processing

Why

```python
Code sample
```

## Post-processing

Why

```python
